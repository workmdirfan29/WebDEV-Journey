    <h1>Welcome to HTML Basics</h1>

    <p>Here’s a simple explanation of what each part of the code does:</p>

    <h2>1. <b>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</b></h2>
    <p>This tells the browser that we are using <b>HTML5</b>. It must be the very first line of our document, so the browser knows how to read it correctly.</p>

    <h2>2. <b>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</b></h2>
    <p>The <b>&lt;html&gt;</b> tag is the start of our webpage. The <b>lang="en"</b> part tells the browser that the page is in English, which helps with accessibility and search engines.</p>

    <h2>3. <b>&lt;head&gt;</b></h2>
    <p>The <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> section contains important information about the webpage, but it doesn’t appear directly on the page you see in the browser.</p>

    <h3>Inside the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b>:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</b>: This line tells the browser to use UTF-8 encoding, which helps display characters from many languages correctly.</li>
      <li><b>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</b>: This makes sure our webpage looks good on mobile devices by setting the correct zoom and width.</li>
      <li><b>&lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;</b>: This sets the name of the webpage that shows up in the browser tab (it’s not shown on the webpage itself, just in the tab).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. <b>&lt;body&gt;</b></h2>
    <p>The <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> section holds everything that will appear on the webpage, like text, images, and links. This is where you add the visible content.</p>

    <h2>5. Comments</h2>
    <p>Comments are notes you can add inside your code to explain things. These don’t show up on the webpage. They look like this:</p>
    <pre><code><b>&lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;</b></code></pre>

    <p>For example, you can use comments to remind yourself what a piece of code does or to explain things to others who read your code.</p>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
